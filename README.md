# Database for control coefficients for Sirius power supplies

Database for coefficients for digital signal processing module (dsp_module) from digital controllers of Sirius power supplies. This module contains the following functions used on implementations of control laws:

* Slew-rate limiters
* First-order low-pass filters
* PI controller with anti-windup
* Second-order and third-order IIR filters (transposed direct-form II)
* DC-Link voltage feed-forward controller
* Linear transformation using 12x12 matrices
